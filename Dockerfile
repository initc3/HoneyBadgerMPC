# Dockerfile contains multiple levels of images--
# First, a base image containing dependencies shared by all other images:
#   - apt dependencies
#   - rust
#   - ntl
#   - pbc
#   - charm
#   - base pip dependencies (cython & setup.py)
# 
# Thereafter, it adds ever increasing levels of dependencies-- 
#   - Test requirements (including doc requirements)
#   - Dev requirements (including aws)
#
# In order to build and push this to dockerhub, run:
# docker build . --target test-image --tag dsluiuc/honeybadgermpc-docker-base
# docker push dsluiuc/honeybadgermpc-docker-base:latest
