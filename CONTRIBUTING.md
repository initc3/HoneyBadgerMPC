# Contributing to HoneyBadgerMPC
See [Getting Started](docs/development/getting-started.rst) to get setup for
developing HoneyBadgerMPC.

The project uses Github issues to manage what needs to be done. Feel free to
create an issue if you have an idea or have a problem to report.

If you are contributing new code it is preferrable that the thing you are
working on is documented in an issue. Once you have an issue to work on see
[Contributing new code](docs/development/contributing.rst) for a presentation
of a development workflow and guidelines for your contributions.

See [Reviewing and merging pull requests](docs/development/reviewing-contributions.rst)
for pull request requirements and merging guidelines.

When a pull request is made a few quality control checks are performed on
Travis CI to ensure that the new code meets basic quality requirements. To
learn more about this important step consult
[Continuous integration](docs/ci.rst) and [Code coverage](docs/ci.rst).

Instructions on preparing a new release are under
[Packaging and Distributing HoneyBadgerMPC](docs/packaging.rst).
