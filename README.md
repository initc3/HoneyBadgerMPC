HoneyBadgerMPC is a research project under active development that aims to
be a novel confidentiality layer for consortium blockchains.

HoneyBadgerMPC is the first system implementation of asynchronous MPC.

HoneyBadgerMPC is the first MPC toolkit to provide all the following desired
properties:

* Scales to large number of nodes (5 to 50). *Viff fails at this!*
* Guarantees output even if some nodes crash or are compromised recent
  developments like SPDZ and EMP-Toolkit fail at this.
* Prevents data breaches even if some nodes are compromised.
