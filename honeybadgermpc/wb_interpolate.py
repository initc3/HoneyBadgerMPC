# an encoder and decoder for Reed-Solomon codes with coefficients in Z/p for a prime p
# decoder uses the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm
#
# Code mostly due to Jeremy Kun
#   https://jeremykun.com/2015/09/07/welch-berlekamp/
#
# Encoding:
#  k=t+1 is the number of code symbols in the original message.
#  We encode these as n evaluations of a degree-t polynomial, where the
#  original t+1 symbols are treated as coefficients of the polynomial.
#  n is the total number of messages sent out == total number of nodes
#
#  Input:
#   k=3, n=4,  message=[k0, k1, k2]
#
#    the degree-t=2 polynomial is  f = k2 x^2 + k1 x + k0
#
#  Output: [ m0=f(w^0),
#            m1=f(w^1),
#            m2=f(w^2),
#            m3=f(w^3) ]
#
# Decoding:
#  Given t+1 correct points, we could correctly decode the degree-t poylomial
#  using ordinary interpolation. Using the B-W algorithm, given t+1+e correct
#  correct points we can identify and remove up to e errors.
#
#  The inputs are passed as list of n points, where at most t+1 points are non-none.
#  None values are treated as erasures.
#  Example:
#  [m0, m1, None, m3]
#
#  Since we have at most n message symbols, the most errors we hope to tolerate
#  is when n=t+1+2e, so e <= maxE = (n-1-t)//2.
#
#  We can also correct a mixture of c erasures and e errors, as long as
#  n=t+1+c+2e.
#
